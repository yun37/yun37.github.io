Characterizing the physical processes that modulate the continuous partitioning of heat between the ocean and overlying atmosphere is important for monitoring the subsequent flow of the heat accumulating in the ocean because of anthropogenic climate change. Oceanic rainfall sensible heat flux (Qp), whereby rainwater cools the sea surface, is computed and compared to the sea surface heat energy balance in the 60°N–60°S region. Contrary to popular belief, the results show that Qp is large at both short and long time scales, accounting for up to 22.5% of sea surface net heat flux around the 5.8°N line of latitude, 10.1% in the tropical 20°N–20°S region, and 5.7% in the global 60°N–60°S region. In the mixed layer of these same regions, area-average temperature change owing to a 10-yr accumulated Qp is up to −2.6° and −1.4°C, respectively. Further analysis reveals a previously unspecified rainfall–evaporation negative feedback between successive evaporation–rainfall cycles at the sea surface. The Qp depresses sea surface temperature and thus inhibits evaporation (latent heat flux), which in turn inhibits rainfall owing to decrease in water vapor supply to the atmosphere. The decrease in sea surface temperature also inhibits heat conduction from the ocean to the atmosphere (sensible heat flux). To compensate for the weaker latent and sensible heat fluxes, sea surface upward longwave radiation flux strengthens. We conclude that Qp acts like a modulator of Earth’s heat energy flow by controlling the partition of upper-ocean heat energy and the cycle of heat flow in the ocean and between the ocean and the atmosphere.
